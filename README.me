This project leverages the Twain Web Scan SDK to implement a proof of concept for scanning documents in the browser.

All of the development was done using GPT4 through prompt engineering.

This application will allow you to upload or scan files to your file system from a twain compatible scanner.

All code was written by AI.

Requirements:

1. Download a Twain SDK Trial License
2. Install Twain Scan Drivers locally
3. Install a virtual twain scanner (or use a real one)
4. Clone repro and install dependencies. 
5. Configure a .env file in the client folder and populate REACT_APP_DWT_PRODUCT_KEY and REACT_APP_SERVER_URL
6. run "npm run startdev" to start a development environment.

This project utilized create-react-app so you will need to run "npm run build" in the client folder if you make any changes and plan to deploy.
